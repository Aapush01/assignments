# Cohort 2.0 Assignment Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the assignments provided during Cohort 2.0. Each assignment question is solved and documented in this repository for reference.

## Structure

The repository is organized by assignment numbers. Each assignment has its dedicated folder with a README file containing the assignment question and a corresponding solution file or folder with the solution code.

## Getting Started

To access the solutions, navigate to the relevant assignment folder. The README file in each folder provides details about the assignment question, and the solution file contains the code implementation.
